# HackCooper: Friend.ly
Our team attempted to create a web application using NodeJS and Firebase hosting.

Friend.ly is an open space chat messenger which randomly connects individuals who wish to vent about a problem/difficulty they are facing to someone who is willing to listen and provide emotional support. There is also an option to choose to speak to a professional and lookup mental health resources near your location. 

This is our attempt at providing connectivity through our application and provide mental health help.
The prototype we made so far only creates a chatbox, but cannot do a 1-1 match with individuals.
We hope to continue this project moving forward.
